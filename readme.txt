Adjust the width of the Admin Menu to accomodate long menu items.

== Description ==

No more line breaks on long menu items! Got a wide screen? Let's use it!

Easily set the width of the Admin Menu from the default `160px` up to `300px` in increments of 10.

When I say easy, I mean *easy*. Like drag a slider and click `Save`. You can manually enter the width too. Pretty hard to screw up.

This plugin adds your width setting to a small `<style>` section in each admin page. A more efficient alternative is to use the separate CSS file `wider-admin-menu.css` in your theme instead of this plugin. See FAQ below.

Wider Admin Menu has been tested on WordPress versions 3.3 to 3.8.1.

This plugin will *leave no trace!* If you delete the plugin, all settings will be removed from the database. Guaranteed. However, simply deactivating it will leave your settings in place, as expected.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wider-admin-menu` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
1. Go to the `Wider Admin Menu` page on the `Settings` menu.
1. Smile with joy at the power of code.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't need a plugin. Can I just add some code to my stylesheet? =

Sure. That's actually how this plugin started out. And if you simply need a wider admin bar and you're cool with CSS then try this: 

Look in the plugin's `/css` folder for the file `wider-admin-menu.css`.

Then either copy its contents to your theme's stylesheet,

OR

copy the file to your theme folder and add this to your theme's `functions.php` to load it:

`
function wpmwam_style() 
{
	wp_enqueue_style( 'wpmwam-style',	get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/wider-admin-menu.css' );
}
add_action( 'admin_enqueue_scripts', 'wpmwam_style' );
`

That covers WordPress 3.8 and up. For WordPress 3.3 to 3.7.1, substitute `wider-admin-menu-33.css`.

Need a hand? I'm on the support forum.

= Leave no trace? What's that about? =

I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this but some plugins and themes don't fully uninstall everything they installed; things like settings, database tables, subdirectories. That bugs me. Sometimes, it bugs your WordPress too. (See what I did there?) For the most part, it's harmless but my thinking is "Why risk it? Why not clean up after yourself?" 

Perhaps the best reason for leaving no trace is to make it easier to debug later. As a WordPress mechanic, I have wasted time tracking down leftover settings just to rule them out as suspects because their plugin or theme was removed. Plugins are like the kitchen and the bathroom: it's easier to keep things clean if you keep 'em clean, know what I mean?

So this plugin will completely remove itself upon deletion. Deactivating the plugin will leave the settings intact, though. As an added bonus, you can switch off "Leave No Trace" so the settings remain after deletion, if you want.

= Where can I submit feature requests? =

On the support forum. If it's doable and adds value and others agree, I'll get right on it. If not, I'll let you know straight up so we don't waste any time.

1. Before: 160px default width.
2. After: the plugin sets the initial width to 200px.
3. The sweet & simple settings page where **you** can set the width from 160px - 300px.
