Make the Admin Menu wider to accomodate long menu items.

== Description ==

Wider Admin Menu by [WP Mission](http://www.wpmission.com) is a lightweight plugin that lets you easily set the width of your admin menu from the default `160px` up to `300px`.

A separate stylesheet is also included if you wish to avoid Yet Another Plugin. See FAQ.

This plugin will *leave no trace!* If you delete the plugin, all settings will be removed from the database. Guaranteed. However, simply deactivating it will leave your settings in place, as expected.

== Installation ==

Option A: Go to Plugins > Add New, search for "wider admin menu", and click "Install Now".

Option B: Download the zip file. Then either: 

Unzip it on your hard drive and upload the `wider-admin-menu` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

OR

Upload the entire zip file via Plugins > Add New > Upload.

Finally, activate the plugin.

By default, the plugin will set the width of the admin menu to `200px`. Go to Settings > Wider Admin Menu to select a new width.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't need a plugin. Can I just add some code to my stylesheet? =

Sure. That's actually how this plugin started out. If you simply need a wider admin bar and you're cool with CSS then try this: 

Look in the plugin's `/css` folder for the file `wider-admin-menu.css`.

Then either copy its contents to your theme's stylesheet,

OR

copy the file to your theme folder and add this to your theme's `functions.php` to load it:

`
function wider_admin_menu() {
  wp_enqueue_style( 'wider-admin-menu', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/wider-admin-menu.css' );
}
add_action( 'admin_enqueue_scripts', 'wider_admin_menu' );
`

That covers WordPress 3.8 and up.

For WordPress 3.5 to 3.7.1, substitute `wider-admin-menu-35.css`.

For WordPress 3.3 to 3.4.2, substitute `wider-admin-menu-33.css`.

= Leave no trace? What's that about? =

Some plugins and themes don't fully uninstall everything they installed - things like settings, database tables, subdirectories. That bugs me. Sometimes, it bugs your WordPress too.

As a WordPress mechanic, I think the best reason for leaving no trace is to make it easier to debug wonky behavior later.

So this plugin will completely remove itself upon deletion. Deactivating the plugin will leave the settings intact, though. As an added bonus, you can switch off "Leave No Trace" so the settings remain after deletion, if you want.
